<p> This is the poem I wrote using AI writer</p>
<p> That summer time was never whispered upon the sea</p>
<p> The glimmer of the wind, where the moon sinks</p>
<p> That pirate fills all day, the torrent</p>
<p> My fire so blind should have so many things</p>
<p> Our paris flies in the forest of the flowers</p>
<p> Our hurt desires are like the breezes of the woods</p>
<p> The advisor of the earth, the resless temple</p>
<p> This hello of the death-silence and the song</p>

<p> Comments:</p>
<p> This poem describes an abstract world that was the brainchild of a little girl daydreaming, it exposes the hypocracy of the society as well as the serenity of the true world, how the human nature can bypass the simplicity and the wonders of life, and only focus on satisfying the avaricious greeds. </p>
